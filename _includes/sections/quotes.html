  Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, "I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide." I always say the same thing to them. I get out a
  pen, I write down my email address. I say, "Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I
  want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide." <strong>Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.</strong></p>

  <p>The primary reason for window curtains in our house, is to stop people from being able to see in. The reason we don’t want them to see in is because we consider much of what we do inside our homes to be private. Whether that be having dinner at the table, watching a movie with your kids, or even engaging in intimate or sexual acts with your partner. None of these things are illegal by any means but even knowing this, we still keep the curtains and blinds on our windows. We clearly have this strong desire for privacy when it comes to our personal life and the public.</p>

  <p>[...] But saying that you don't need or want privacy because you have nothing to hide is to assume that no one should have, or could have, to hide anything -- including their immigration status, unemployment history, financial history, and health records. You're assuming that no one, including yourself, might object to revealing to anyone information about their religious beliefs, political affiliations, and sexual activities, as casually as some choose to reveal their movie and music tastes and reading preferences.</p>

  <p>Privacy is not a luxury [in America]: it is a right – one that we need to defend in the digital realm as much as in the physical realm. We need to stay vigilant to maintain access to that right, though ... especially as technology continues to advance...</p>

  <p>Ultimately, saying that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different from saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say.  Or that you don't care about freedom of the press because you don't like to read. Or that you don't care about freedom of religion because you don't believe in God. Or that you don't care about the freedom to peacably assemble because you're a lazy, antisocial agoraphobe. </p>

  <p>美國國家安全局建置了一套設施，其幾乎可以攔截任何通訊。這套設備的能力，大多數人類的通訊都會自動地被吸納進去而不是針對特定目標。如果我想要看你的電子郵件內容或是你老婆的電話，我只須要利用這套設備進行攔截，就可以取得你的電子郵件、密碼、電信通聯記錄、信用卡資料等等。我不想活在一個做這種勾當的社會裏，我不想要活在一個任何所做的事所說的話都被記錄下來的世界。這不是我願意支持或是生活的地方。 </p>

  <p>每個人都需要有地方可以去探索而不依靠別人施加的眼光，只有在一個不必被放大檢視的地方我們才可以真正地測試出自己的極限。真正的私領域才能允許不同聲音、創造力和個人試探式的謊言。</p>
